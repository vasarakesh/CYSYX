# CYSYX
•	Conducted an in-depth performance benchmarking study comparing Flask (Python), Express.js (Node.js), and Actix Web (Rust) frameworks under high-concurrency workloads simulating up to 5,000 requests.
•	Demonstrated Actix Web's superior performance, achieving a peak throughput of 7180.86 requests/sec, significantly outperforming Express.js (4320.93 requests/sec) and Flask (706.15 requests/sec) under maximum load.
•	Showcased Actix Web's significantly lower average latency (13.926 ms at 5000 requests) compared to Express.js (23.143 ms) and Flask (141.613 ms), highlighting its efficiency.
•	Utilized Apache JMeter for load testing, generating over 10,000 requests per test cycle per framework, and Postman for API endpoint verification, with 0 failed requests for all frameworks.
